As of sshguard 2.0 backends and log readers are configured with /etc/sshguard.conf
A sample config file is installed at /usr/share/sshguard/sshguard.conf.sample

To configure sshguard, copy the sample config and modify it to your preference.
At a minimum the BACKEND option and one of FILES or LOGREADER should be set.

    cp /usr/share/sshguard/sshguard.conf.sample /etc/sshguard.conf

Available backends are installed in /usr/libexec/sshg-fw-*

    ls /usr/libexec/sshg-fw-*
