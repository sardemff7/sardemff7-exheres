SUMMARY="A tiling window manager, completely written from scratch"
DESCRIPTION="
i3 was created because wmii, our favorite window manager at the time, didn’t provide some features
we wanted (multi-monitor done right, for example), had some bugs, didn’t progress since quite
some time and wasn’t easy to hack at all (source code comments/documentation completely lacking).
Still, we think the wmii developers and contributors did a great job. Thank you for inspiring us
to create i3.

Please be aware that i3 is primarily targeted at advanced users and developers.
