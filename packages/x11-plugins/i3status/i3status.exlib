SUMMARY="A small generator for status bars"
DESCRIPTION="
i3status is a small program (about 1500 SLOC) for generating a status bar for dzen2, xmobar or
similar programs. It is designed to be very efficient by issuing a very small number of system
calls, as one generally wants to update such a status line every second. This ensures that even
under high load, your status bar is updated correctly. Also, it saves a bit of energy by not
hogging your CPU as much as spawning the corresponding amount of shell commands would.
